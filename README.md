The widespread use of point-and-shoot hand held x-ray fluorescence (XRF)
instruments in cultural heritage research, would suggest that it is easy
enough for anyone to find out the elemental composition of materials.
Alas, due to myriads of emission energies, escape peaks and other
nuisances, reliable interpretation of x-ray fluorescence spectra is
actually hard. If you are not yet deterred, just read the [Handheld XRF
in Cultural Heritage - A practical workbook for
conservators](http://www.getty.edu/conservation/publications_resources/pdf_publications/pdf/handheld-xrf-cultural-heritage.pdf)
with many, many examples of spectra that was recently made available
on-line by the Getty Conservation Institute.

My take on this as a physicist and a python programmer is that instead
of learning from data directly (i.e.Â staring at measured spectra), a
nicer route to insight exists. Due to huge efforts and advances of the
open source scientific computing community it is nowadays possible to
install readily available python packages and create physics simulations
and visualizations with a few lines of computer code. Once you
understand why certain patterns of peaks appear, it becomes much more
easy to interpret XRF spectra reliably.

If you would like to adapt this plot to your own needs, for instance to
to see what happens if you change beam energy, you can install this
package yourself.

    $ pip install moseley
